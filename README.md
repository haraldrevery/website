# Harald Revery official website

Harald Revery official website, made with Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js and GLightbox.

* Tailwind CSS: [Website](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Github](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)
* Alpine.js [Website](https://alpinejs.dev/), [Github](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine)
* GLightbox [Website](https://biati-digital.github.io/glightbox/), [Github](https://github.com/biati-digital/glightbox)

Alpine.js was used for "navigation bar reveal when scroll" on older browsers and to run a custom made audio player. GLightbox for pop out image sliders when the user clicks an image (the CSS trick was not good enough). 


Main LLM models used to generate and troubleshoot code:
* Anthropic: Claude AI (Sonnet 4.5)
* Google: Gemini 
* xAI: Grok

Personal setup for this project:
* Windows 10 with Firefox, Edge Zen with JavaScript blocker
* VS Code with the Live Server extension by Ritwick Dey
* Tailwind CSS v4.1.18  (tailwindcss-windows-x64.exe)

Then I just run:
.\tw.exe -i input.css -o main.css --watch --content "./*.html"
